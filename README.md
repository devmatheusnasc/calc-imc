# BMI Calculator

Welcome to my BMI calculator! With it, you can calculate your Body Mass Index (BMI) and find out if you have a healthy weight.

# How to use
Access the website: [Click here to visit my website](https://calc-imc-cruz.netlify.app)

Enter your weight and height in the indicated fields.

Click the "Calculate" button to get your BMI.

In addition, the website also offers a description of what BMI is and how to interpret the results.

# About the project
This project was developed in React + Typescript as part of my programming learning journey. Feel free to explore the source code and suggest improvements.

Visit the website to learn more about the BMI calculator and other amazing tools that I plan to develop. Join me on this journey towards knowledge and continuous improvement!


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
